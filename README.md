A portfolio of small Java programs solving coding challenges inspired by LeetCode.
These programs emphasize the use of Java fundamentals — loops, conditionals, classes, and collections — as well as key algorithmic techniques 
such as binary search, recursion, and dynamic programming and effective use of Java libraries such as HashMap, ArrayList, and Stack.
